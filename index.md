Hello!

I'm Sara, and I work as a researcher at the University of the Basque Country (EHU/UPV), specifically at the Aeronautics [Aeronautics Advanced Manufacturing Center](https://cfaa.eus/en/) (CFAA).

This website summarizes my professional journey, the projects I've been involved in, and provides ways to get in touch with me or review my code if you're interested!

### RESEARCH
My research has primarily focused on additive technologies, culminating in my doctoral thesis in this field, where I developed a model for predicting surface roughness.

Today, I'm dedicated to data analytics and predictive models to mitigate defects in manufactured parts. You can find my list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sMQHtnoAAAAJ).
